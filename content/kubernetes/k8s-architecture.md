## Control Plane Components

Kubernetes control plane consists of several key components that manage the cluster state:

### API Server
The API server is the central management entity that receives all REST requests for modifications to pods, services, and other Kubernetes objects.

### etcd
A consistent and highly-available key-value store used as Kubernetes' backing store for all cluster data.

### Scheduler
Watches for newly created Pods with no assigned node and selects a node for them to run on.

### Controller Manager
Runs controller processes that regulate the state of the cluster.

## Worker Nodes

Worker nodes run the containerized applications:

- **kubelet**: Agent that ensures containers are running in a Pod
- **kube-proxy**: Network proxy maintaining network rules
- **Container Runtime**: Software responsible for running containers (e.g., containerd, CRI-O)

## Example Pod Definition

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: nginx-pod
spec:
  containers:
  - name: nginx
    image: nginx:latest
    ports:
    - containerPort: 80
```

This architecture enables Kubernetes to orchestrate containerized applications at scale.

## ✅ Quick Answers Corner

Q: What does this command return?
kubectl get pods -l env=prod -n staging
A: Lists all Pods in the staging namespace that are labeled env=prod.
Bonus Challenge (Think Like a Pro)
 
Q: What does this command do?
kubectl get pods -l 'tier in (frontend,backend)' -n dev 
--field-selector=status.phase=Running
A: Lists all running Pods in the dev namespace with the label tier = frontend or tier = backend.
So far, you’ve launched Pods and exposed them with Services. But here’s the real-world problem… 
What happens if a Pod crashes?
What if you want 5 copies of the same app running?
What if you need to update your app without downtime?
That’s where Deployments and ReplicaSets come in.

![Deployments and ReplicaSets](../Images/Deployments%20and%20Replicasets.png)

What’s a ReplicaSet?

A ReplicaSet ensures that the correct number of identical Pods is always running.
If a Pod crashes → a new one is created
If you scale to more replicas → more Pods are created automatically
Example:
```yaml
replicas: 3
selector:
  matchLabels:
    app: web
```

This tells Kubernetes to keep 3 Pods running that match the label app=web.
 
📌 You rarely create ReplicaSets directly — you use a Deployment to do it.
So What’s a Deployment?

A Deployment is a higher-level object that manages ReplicaSets for you.
It can:
* Create and maintain ReplicaSets
* Handle rolling updates
* Perform version rollbacks
* Define how your app should run (via the Pod Template)

📌 Think of a Deployment as your app’s “control system.”

Simple Deployment Example

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: web-deployment
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: web
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: web
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: nginx
          image: nginx:1.21
          ports:
            - containerPort: 80
```
This will:

Create a ReplicaSet with 3 Pods
Run NGINX version 1.21
Ensure all Pods are labeled app=web
What’s a Pod Template?

Inside the Deployment YAML, the template: section is your Pod Template.
It’s the blueprint used to create all future Pods in that Deployment.
If a Pod is restarted or recreated, it’s rebuilt based on this template.

## What Happens When You Update the Image?

Let’s say you update the image from nginx:1.21 to nginx:1.22.
You run:
* kubectl apply -f web-deployment.yaml
* Kubernetes will:
* Launch new Pods with the new image
* Wait for them to be healthy
* Delete the old Pods
* Complete the update — with zero downtime

## Want to Roll Back?
 
You can easily undo any update with:
kubectl rollout undo deployment web-deployment

📌 Kubernetes tracks deployment history, so you can revert anytime.

## Useful Commands to Try

* kubectl get deployments
* kubectl describe deployment web-deployment
* kubectl scale deployment web-deployment --replicas=5
* kubectl rollout status deployment web-deployment
* kubectl rollout undo deployment web-deployment
## Quick Summary

Concept	What It Does	Why It Matters
ReplicaSet	Ensures # of Pods is always running	Auto-healing, consistent scaling
Deployment	Manages ReplicaSets + updates/rollbacks	Safer changes, simplified control
Pod Template	Blueprint for new Pods	Used when recreating/replacing

## Quick Review
* What keeps Pods running? → ReplicaSet
* What helps update your app version? → Deployment
* Where do recreated Pods come from? → Pod Template
